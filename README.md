# Bakery Application – Programming Technologies

This repository contains the coursework project for the **Programming Technologies** subject. The application represents a multilayer system simulating a **bakery**, and it demonstrates object-oriented principles, including **polymorphism**.

## Project Structure

The application is developed in **C#** and follows a clear multilayer architecture:

* **Data Layer** – Handles data models and storage mechanisms.
* **Logic Layer** – Contains the business logic, including polymorphic behaviors of bakery items.
* **View Layer** – Implements the user interface using the **Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM)** architectural pattern.

## Features

* Multilayer architecture promoting separation of concerns
* Polymorphic handling of bakery product types
* MVVM-based user interface
* Clean and modular C# implementation

Feel free to explore the codebase and use it as a reference for studying multilayer architecture, MVVM, and object-oriented design principles.
